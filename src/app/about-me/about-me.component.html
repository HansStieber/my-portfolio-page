            <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-once="true" translate>I am a front-end developer based in TÃ¼bingen, Germany with experience in
                building web apps using JavaScript & Angular. My journey in IT began many years ago during my studies
                when I started to write simple add-on programs using Python in order to analyze spatial data using
                graphical information systems.</p>

                </div>
                <p translate>That experience sparked my interest in the field, and my passion for programming has never
                    faded. Since then, I have continued to dive deeper into the world of technology and have explored
                    various programming languages and tools. Close contact with my father-in-law, a self-taught and
                    experienced web developer, has also fed my enthusiasm to become a developer myself and given me
                    important insights into the world of professional development.</p>

                <p translate>In October 2022, I finally decided to turn professional and started an online coding
                    seminar at the Developer Akademie, a professional coding school based in Munich. It has been an
                    incredible journey thus far, filled with challenges, learning, and growth. Now, I am looking forward
                    to starting my career in IT!</p>
